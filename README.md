Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in Java

Specification
The Rock-Paper-Scissors game is a classic two-player game. The goal of the game is to determine which player wins by comparing the moves of both players. In this program, the player plays against the computer. The player enters an integer to make their move (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, or 3 for Scissors), and the computer randomly generates its move. The program then outputs the result of the game and asks the player if they want to play again.

Correctness and Exception Handling
The program uses a while loop to allow the player to keep playing the game until they choose not to. The player's input is first validated to ensure that it is an integer between 1 and 3. If the player enters an invalid integer, the program prints an error message and asks for their choice again.

Code Clarity
The code is written in a clear and readable way, with meaningful variable names and clear indentation. The program uses if-else statements to handle the different possible outcomes of the game and determine the winner. The program also uses a Scanner object to read the player's input and a random number generator to determine the computer's move. The program is well-commented to make it easy to understand what is happening at each step.
